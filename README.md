Sorting is one of the most fundamental algorithmic problems within computer science. It has been
claimed that as many as 25% of all CPU cycles are spent sorting, which provides a lot of incentive
for further study and optimization of sorting. In addition, there are many other tasks (searching,
calculating the median, finding the mode, remove duplicates, etc.) that can be implemented much
more efficiently once the data is sorted. Sorting is spectacular in that there are many varied
approaches (divide-and-conquer, partitioning, pigeonhole, etc.) that lead to useful sorting algorithms,
and those techniques often can be repurposed to other algorithmic tasks. The wide variety of
algorithms gives us a lot of richness to explore, especially when considering the tradeoffs offered in
terms of efficiency, operation mix, code complexity, best/worse case inputs, and so on. (In case it
wasn‚Äôt totally obvious in lecture, I love sorting‚Ä¶) Your next task is to do some exploration into
sorting algorithms in a playful, experimental way‚Äî I hope you enjoy it!
Part A ‚Äî Sort Detective
Back in the day, students in high school chemistry class were often given an unknown compound
and asked to figure out what it was in a process called qualitative analysis. In this problem, your job
is to take several unknown algorithms and figure out what they are by experimenting with their
computational properties in much the same way.
We give you a compiled library containing five sorting routines, named MysterySort1, MysterySort2, and so on. Each function is designed to take a vector of numbers and order the
elements into ascending order. What‚Äôs different about them is that each uses a different sorting
algorithm. More specifically, the algorithms used are (in alphabetical order):
‚Ä¢ Bubble sort
‚Ä¢ Insertion sort
‚Ä¢ Merge sort
‚Ä¢ Quicksort, where first element of subvector is used as pivot
‚Ä¢ Selection sort
We talked about four of these algorithms in class and they are covered in Chapter 7 of the reader
(Insertion Sort appears as exercise 7-2). The only missing algorithm is bubble sort. Bubble sort is
an interesting bit of computer science history. It is a simple O(N2) algorithm that works by
repeatedly stepping through the elements to be sorted, comparing two items at a time, swapping them
if they are out of order. The pass through the elements is repeated until no swaps are needed, which
means the data is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way elements ‚Äúbubble‚Äù to the correct
position. Here is pseudo-code for the bubble sort algorithm:
loop doing passes over the elements until sorted
a pass goes from start to end
compare each adjacent pair of elements
if the two are out of order, swap
if no pairs were exchanged on this pass, you‚Äôre done
Bubble sort is a rather weak algorithm that for some strange reason dominates introductory courses
(despite the fact that it has just enough subtlety to often be demonstrated with bugs). Owen
Astrachan, a friend and colleague of mine at Duke, once presented a fascinating ‚Äúarchaeological
excavation‚Äù into the history of bubble sort, trying to find out why this rather unexceptional quadratic
2
performer was so popular. His efforts turned up little more than tradition, which I guess makes
bubble sort mostly a hazing ritual for computer scientists. After this assignment, you can consider
yourself a participant in this long and venerable tradition!
Your job as sort detective is to figure out which algorithm is implemented by each mystery sort. In
addition to identifying the algorithm, your submission must include an explanation of the evidence
you used to make your decision.
To a certain extent, you‚Äôre on your own in terms of figuring out how to run these experiments.
However it should be clear that timing provides a very important clue. The difference in an algorithm
that runs in O(N2) time versus O(N log N) must certainly be reflected in a significant difference in
how the running time changes as the size of the input increases. Moreover, some of these algorithms
work more or less quickly depending on the arrangement of elements in the starting configuration,
so carefully preparing different inputs and comparing the resulting performance could provide useful
information. Our mystery sorting routines also include a feature that allows you to specify a
maximum amount of time for the sort to run. By choosing an appropriate value, you can stop the sort
mid-stream, and then use the debugger (or print statements) to examine the partially sorted data and
try to determine the pattern with which the elements are being rearranged. Through a combination of
these types of experiments, you should be able to figure out which algorithm is which and assert
your conclusions with confidence.
Timing an operation
Gauging performance by measuring elapsed time (e.g. using your watch) is rather imprecise and can
be affected by other concurrent tasks on your computer. A better way to measure elapsed system
time for programs is to use the standard clock function, which is exported by the standard ctime
interface. The clock function takes no arguments and returns the amount of time the processing unit
of the computer has used in the execution of the program. The unit of measurement and even the
type used to store the result of clock differ depending on the type of machine, but you can always
convert the system-dependent clock units into seconds by using the following expression:
double(clock()) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC
If you record the starting and finishing times in the variables start and finish, you can use the
following code to compute the time required by a calculation:
#include
int main()
{
double start = double(clock()) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
. . . Perform some calculation . . . double finish = double(clock()) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
double elapsed = finish ‚Äì start;
}
Unfortunately, calculating the time requirements for a program that runs quickly requires some
subtlety because there is no guarantee that the system clock unit is precise enough to measure the
elapsed time. For example, if you used this strategy to time the process of sorting 10 integers, the
odds are good that the time value of elapsed at the end of the code fragment would be 0. The reason
is that the processing unit on most machines can execute many instructions in the space of a single
clock tick‚Äîalmost certainly enough to get the entire sorting process done for 10 elements. Because
the system‚Äôs internal clock may not tick in the interim, the values recorded for start and finish are
likely to be the same.
3
One way to get around this problem is to repeat the calculation many times between the two calls to
the clock function. For example, if you want to determine how long it takes to sort 10 numbers, you
can perform the sort-10-numbers experiment 1000 times in a row and then divide the total elapsed
time by 1000. This strategy gives you a timing measurement that is much more accurate. Part of
your experimentation is figuring out how many times you need to perform the sort operation for
different-sized inputs in order to get reasonably accurate results.
The write-up
You are to identify the mystery sorts and justify your conclusions. Your write-up should
demonstrate that you understand the differences in the sorting algorithms and can identify how those
differences are reflected when observing the algorithms at work. Please keep things low-key (i.e. no
need for multi-color graphs with dozens of data points), however, you should write in clear and
complete English sentences and include details of the experimental data that substantiates your
claims. If your experiments are well chosen, this write-up can be quite succinct.

Part B ‚Äî Write your own generic sort
In lecture and in the reader, the sort functions operate on vectors of integers. In practice, we also need
to sort other types of data. Writing a new sorting routine for each type is clearly not desirable. C++
templates allow you to write a single polymorphic function capable of handling different data types.
Such a template would take a comparison function as an argument, which allows the client to provide
a suitable method of comparison or use the built-in relational operators if appropriate.
For this part, you are to write a fully generic sorting function. It should take two parameters, a vecto
of elements and an optional function pointer to compare elements. If the client doesn‚Äôt supply a
comparison function, the elements should be compared using the built-in relational operators via our
standard comparison function. The prototype for this function will thus be
template
void Sort(Vector &v, int (cmpFn)(Type, Type) = OperatorCmp)
(An aside about quirky C++ syntax: the default argument, i.e. the = expr part, should not be
repeated on the definition for a function that has a separate prototype. If there is no separate
prototype, then the definition does include the default argument.)
Here‚Äôs the twist: we want you to implement a different algorithm than the ones we‚Äôve already
discussed. There are many other sorting algorithms and rather than deciding for you which one to
implement, we are giving you the latitude to do a little research and choose one that interests you.
Living in the wondrous Information Age, you have many great resources you can draw upon to
further explore the wide world of sorting. Here are a dozen names to start your investigation:
Bingo sort
Bogo sort (ok, this one is super-dumb, but has a cute name üôÇ
Comb sort
Gnome sort
Heap sort
Introsort
Library sort (relative newcomer, published in 2004)
Fancy Mergesort (variants include in-place, k-way, bottom-up, natural, etc.)
Shaker sort (usually means bi-directional Bubble, but also sometimes bi-directional Selection)
Shell sort (or variants Brick sort and Shake sort)
4
Strand sort (could be implemented using our container classes to manage the strands)
Fancy Quicksort (i.e. improvements in pivot choice/partitioning strategy/hybrid crossover/etc.)
Or another of your own choosing or something you designed yourself‚Ä¶ surprise us!
Here are a few useful web sites on algorithms that might help you get started:
Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_algorithms
NIST https://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/sort.html
Google Directory

Open Source Software Educational Society
https://www.softpanorama.org/Algorithms/sorting.shtml
On the web and in books, you will find descriptions of algorithms, animations, pseudo-code, and
even implemented code in all variety of programming languages. You can make use of any of these,
as long as you properly cite your references. However, we strongly recommend implementing the
algorithm yourself (starting from pseudocode or a conceptual description) rather than copying some
existing code line-for-line. A word of caution: don‚Äôt believe everything you read! The web isn‚Äôt
known for its fact-checking and even textbooks and published articles (and Stanford lectures üôÇ have
been known to have errors in their code. As the CS legend Don Knuth says ‚ÄúAn algorithm must be
seen to be believed‚Äù. Implement and test carefully!
We recommend that you first implement your sort to operate on integers. That is an easier context in
which to get the algorithm written and debugged. Once that‚Äôs done, go back and make the necessary
modifications to transform it into a generic template version that uses a comparison function. Be sure
to test the generic version on several different data types using the default and client-supplied
callback functions, so you are confident it can handle anything you throw at it.
Lastly, you are to implement two comparison functions to practice writing callbacks. One is a string
comparison function that can be passed to your sort function to sort a vector of strings in order of
increasing string length, breaking ties by alphabetical ordering. The second is a comparison function
that can be passed to your sort function to sort a Vector of Set in order of increasing sum (i.e. a
Set containing {1, 2, 3} is ordered before one containing {2, 8}).
Once you have your code finished, you will write a paragraph or two describing its features to us.
What it is Big-O running time? How does it compare to other sorts within its Big-O class? Does it
have any best/worst-case inputs? What is the mix of operations (compare/swap/function calls) it
uses? Did you make any optimizations or improvements when implementing the algorithm? How
complicated is the code? What do you see as the overall strengths and weaknesses of this algorithm?
Special note on the Honor Code
For this assignment, we are encouraging you to use outside sources. Some of the information you
find may be more helpful than others, so you may feel unsure on what is fair to use. Here‚Äôs our take
on it: we expect you to do your own independent inquiry, to clearly cite what resources you used to
complete your work, and to understand and be able to explain all of the code that you submit. We do
think you will learn the most if you write your own implementation starting from an algorithm
description or pseudo-code. If you do find pre-written code that you choose to adapt instead, you
should clearly indicate that in your citation and carefully work through the code to ensure you
thoroughly understand it. When you‚Äôre done, what you submit should feel like ‚Äúyour‚Äù code, no
matter what its origins.
Extensions
With midterms in the air, we figure you won‚Äôt have many spare cycles, but we wouldn‚Äôt want you to
go away empty-handed if you come seeking an extra challenge. Here are a few ideas just in case:
5
‚Ä¢ Optimize the sort you implemented. Try to knock our socks off with how fast you can make it!
Take inspiration from Jon Bentley (hero to programmers worldwide) about optimizing
Quicksort (‚ÄúEngineering a sort function‚Äù https://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=172710). Many
standard C/C++ library sorting routines derive from Jon‚Äôs version. Although not all of these
techniques he discusses are applicable to all sorting algorithms, it‚Äôs a fascinating investigation
into how to pursue optimization.
‚Ä¢ Writing a sort routine to sort a linked list. We have focused on sorting arrays/vectors, which
both benefit and suffer from the arrangement of elements in contiguous memory. The dynamic
pointed-based arrangement of a linked list makes for a different context in which to evaluate the
tradeoffs among sorting algorithms. Many of the standard sorting algorithms can be adapted to
operate on a linked list, but some are certainly better suited (i.e. easier to implement, result in
better efficiency, and so on). Before you choose, think carefully about which of the algorithms
are a good fit for the particular strengths and weaknesses of a singly-linked list.
‚Ä¢ A stable sorting algorithm preserves the relative order of elements with equal values. For
example, if a list of students is sorted by student ID number and then re-sorted by last name,
those students with the same last name would remain in order of ID number if the sort were
stable. Of the sort algorithms we have studied, which can be implemented to be stable? Can you
devise an experiment that would determine if our mystery implementation is stable?
‚Ä¢ Although an O(N log N) algorithm is certainly more efficient than an O(N2) for large inputs, the
overhead of the more complex algorithm can dominate the cost for when the input is small,
causing it to take more time than a simpler quadratic approach. The crossover point is the size
at which the more efficient algorithm starts to outperform. Find the crossover point between the
O(N log N) and O(N2) algorithms from Part A. A hybrid algorithm is one that combines two or
more algorithms to exploit the best features of each. The crossover point would be useful in
writing a hybrid sort that delegates to several algorithms behind the scenes, depending on which
operates most effectively on the input size.
‚Ä¢ Doug McIlroy, former head of Bell Labs research, wrote this entertaining paper (‚ÄúA Killer
Adversary for Quicksort‚Äù https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/mdmspe.pdf) about
manipulating the input to force almost any Quicksort implementation into its degenerate
behavior. Very interesting reading! The setup is in straight C code, so you have to deal with
some void* goop, but try running the adversary against the qsort in your C environment and
report how this mischievous code does relative to an ordinary input.
Accessing files
On the class web site, you‚Äôll find a starter folder containing these files:
mysterysort.lib/h Interface/implementation for MysterySort functions
When working on Part A, be sure to add mysterysort.lib file to your project so that the linker
will find the mystery functions.
Deliverables
You are to submit a text file for the written part and a C++ source file of your code. For Part A,
identify each the mystery sorts and include the evidence for your determination. For Part B,
introduce your chosen algorithm and describe its characteristics. The source file should contain
your Sort template and the two comparison callback functions. Your source file can also contain any
testing code you used. Hand in a printed version in lecture, and submit all files electronically via ftp.
Submissions are due before the beginning of lecture on the due date.
